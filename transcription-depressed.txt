1. In the past two weeks, I’ve been feeling down almost every day. It’s hard to remember the last time I didn’t feel this way.
2. Yes, I’ve had a lot of overwhelming sadness. Sometimes it feels like it comes out of nowhere and just takes over.
3. I’d rate my happiness as a 1 or 2. Honestly, I don’t feel happy at all most of the time.
4. I feel anxious almost constantly. It’s like there’s this weight on me that I can’t shake off.
5. I’ve been worrying a lot about everything—my job, my relationships, my future. It feels like my mind just doesn’t stop.
6. My sleep is terrible. Either I can’t fall asleep or I sleep too much and still feel exhausted. I never wake up feeling rested.
7. I can’t concentrate on anything for very long. I forget things all the time and it’s really frustrating.
8. I don’t feel connected to anyone anymore. I’ve been avoiding friends and family because I just don’t have the energy for it.
9. I haven’t really been doing anything I enjoy. Things that used to make me happy don’t seem to matter anymore.
10. I feel really bad about myself. I’ve been having a lot of negative thoughts, and it’s hard to see anything positive.
